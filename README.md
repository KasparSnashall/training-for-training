AI training note books on guess what? Training AIs of course!

This will involve many types of machine learning. My main aim is to have fun and show that machine learning is pretty simple to learn, perhaps difficult to master. 
## Topics to cover
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- RNNs
- Transformers
- Basics of neural networks
- Optimisation of various problems

## Off topics I also explored
- Flask for server systems and GUIs
